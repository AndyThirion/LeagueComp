BACK END

Flesh out backend with
	main index route
	
	data route
		coded to data object
		
		//This will need to be redesigned depending on
		   final object structure
		/data/:<champion or teamcomp/:key
			This will be used for $.get requests to
			 grab data from backend
	
	Store data as JSON object to start
		Finalize data structure and contents
		See "Finalize JSON data object" in Front End

	Write submission process to automatically update
	  data object.
	  	Allow submission from a form page accessible to trusted users

	Implement mongodb later
	
	Add user authentication using Oauth2
	Include submission form for trusted users
		(Platinum and above)


FRONT END

Add a way to show jumbotron if champion selection process
	is cancelled by clicking outside of a modal
	(.modal-backdrop seems like the correct object to trigger
		but I haven't made it work yet)

Style modals to auto blur background

Add text content to main jumbotron

Style "icon select" from inside modal
	on selected
		opacity to 75%
		OR border
		AND height bump css animation



Complete champion icon select event that
  populates a new modal with design specs 
  currently in main.js

Create teamcomp modal modeled after champselect
	List of team comps with a picture and short desc
	  in 4/4/4 cols (pattern after thumbnail list in bs)

Finalize JSON data object
	data structure
	contents
		full (strong) champ list
			with synergies
			with working templated icon display code
				No more if (name == x) workarounds
			with tags for which team comps they work in
		team comp list
			pattern data and structure from final/data.JSON


DATA OBJECT
Characters:
	Write full list of characters to be included for beta
	Each character entry in data object needs:
		name: "Lee Sin"
		key: "leesin"
		tagline: "The Blind Monk"
		img: "http://leagueapedia.com/leesin.png"
		synergies: ["yasuo", "other champion"]
		synergiesdesc: "Lee sin excells when paired with champions that
					are strong early and can make plays during laning
					phase. Alternately he can be used to protect weak
					laners during their most vulnerable time"
					//Short description of how he pairs with other champs
		teamcomps: ["pick", "hard engage", "splitpush"]
					OR
				   {pick: "description of why", hardEngage: "desc of why"}
		teamcompsdesc: "Lee Sin is perfect for team comps that require
						early power and mobility, as well as strong
						initiation with Dragon's Rage"
	CONSIDER BUILDING QUICK HTML FORM TO EASILY INPUT THIS AND
	   SEND BACK A JSON.TOSTRING
